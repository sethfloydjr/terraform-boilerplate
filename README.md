# terraform-boilerplate
Sets up the directory structure and base files that you need to get started working with Terraform. Handy for setting up a quick test bed.

## Summary

* This repo is an easy way to clone and use a boilerplate set of files that all Terraform stacks need. I use this for when I need to do any sort of quick tests and I dont want to make changes to existing code or alter any existing statefiles.

* This stack creates and uses a local statefile. You can edit as needed in the `_backend.tf` file.

## How To Use

* Look through each file and edit as needed.
